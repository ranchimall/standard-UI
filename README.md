# [Standard UI](https://ranchimall.github.io/standard-ui/)

### So what is Standard UI?
Suppose you want to start a web project. Instead of doing the UI from scratch, you want to start with pre-built UI which is responsive, which takes care of good fonts, which has nice visual elements. We have frameworks like bootstraps available, but they do not provide inbuilt default page layout. 

RanchiMall Standard UI solves that problem. It provides out of box page layouts, and also provides native web components. A normal developer who is not good at UI skills will find the most of UI work already done in Standard UI, and the developer has to just customize them as he wish. This reduces development time by a large degree and avoids re-inventing the wheel. 

### How is Standard UI different than frameworks like Bootstrap?
As Bootstrap just provides additional CSS classes. Standard UI goes much beyond this and provides fully responsive working page layouts, extra HTML tags, and extra Javascript functions.

### How to use Standard UI?
1. Pick your layout from `Layouts` folder [`https://github.com/ranchimall/standard-ui/tree/master/Layouts`](https://github.com/ranchimall/standard-ui/tree/master/Layouts)
2. Add the additional components by selecting the components you need, downloading the `.js` files and adding them to your project. Select and download components from [`https://ranchimall.github.io/standard-ui/components/`](https://ranchimall.github.io/standard-ui/components/)
3. You also need Standard Operations for Cryptographic, blockchain and cloud operations. They are included by default in each of the layouts. But you need to read about it to understand at [`https://github.com/ranchimall/Standard_Operations`](https://github.com/ranchimall/Standard_Operations)
4. Start building the code!


### Layouts Available

#### Box Layout also known as bottom-navbar layout
This layout comes with a sidebar of menu items on the desktop size screen which converts into the bottom navbar on mobile. It should be used when there are less than 5 main pages in the app for quick access on small screen

#### Many sections layout 
A layout suitable for long-form content with mainly one page like landing pages or articles. This is the simplest layout of the bunch. Every landing page consists of many sections, each of which can be populated as per the functionality

#### Side-bar layout
This layout is similar to boxes layout such that it also has a sidebar when on a bigger screen estate. the main difference can be seen on smaller screens. The side-bar is hidden by default which acts as classic hamburger menu on small screen devices which can be accessed by hamburger icon in the header. This should be used when the nmber of pages is more than 5. Our components explanation page uses Sidebar layout [`https://ranchimall.github.io/standard-ui/components/`](https://ranchimall.github.io/standard-ui/components/)

#### Tabs layout
This layout is more suitable for small screen devices with a limited number of main screens that can be traversed with swipe gestures, Example of the type of apps that uses this layout would be messaging apps like WhatsApp.

#### What's included in layouts by default?
- Components ( sm-button, sm-input, sm-notifications, sm-popup, theme-toggle and optional components specific to respective layout )
- Main_UI.js - A JS library that includes utility functions and some common functionality.
- Standard operations - A JS library **created by RanchiMall** to create DAPPs easily. 

Now that we know what's included in layouts, let's dig a little deeper and know exact functionality of each of these.

## Components
Components are HTML tags in themselves. These HTML tags have added functionality and design elements than what out of box browser HTML tags provide. Like `<sm-textarea></sm-textarea>` is a component which has been created by extending functionality of `<textarea></textarea>` and making it content aware. So it is better to use `<sm-textarea></sm-textarea>` rather than `<textarea></textarea>` 

These are the components we provide
* Button
* Carousel
* Checkbox
* Copy
* File input
* Form
* Hamburger menu
* Input
* Menu
* Notifications
* Popup
* Radio button
* Switch
* Select
* Spinner
* Strip select
* Tabs
* Tags input
* Textarea
* Text-Field
* Theme toggle

These are the building blocks of modern web development process. We are a frameworkless environment so we decided to go with **native Web Components** as a way to create reusable components. There are lot of these already created and ready to use.

### How to additionally style layouts and components
Components are full functional with accompanied HTML, Javascript and CSS. Usually in-the-box CSS of Standard UI is good enough for most cases. You can add your own CSS in main.css of individual layout file. You can only modify the CSS of components if you define CSS variables in main.css file. By applying normal style against component HTML tag in main.css file, the component style will not change, as it is encapuslated in the definition of component.

## main_UI.js
This is a collection of utility and commonly used functions that will help ease the development process. 

* getRef - shortens document.getElementById('sample') to getRef('sample')

* createElement - shortens `var x = document.createElement('div'); x.innerHTML = "My Text";` to `createElement('div',{innerHTML:"My Text"});`

* debounce - introduces a defined delay when the same function is executed again `debounce(functionToBeExecuted, 2000)` will not interfere with the first execution of funtionToBeExecuted. But it will slow down the second execution onwards of funtionToBeExecuted

* showPopUp - This will expose and open a popup if the ID is provided `showPopUp("ID_of_popUp");`

* getConfirmation - This will remove the need for user confirmation for things like signout, and they can be programatically confirmed. It replaces the functionality of `confirm` function in Javascript to allow style customization of system confirm message, and change ok/cancel texts

* getPromptInput - This allows customization of inbuilt Javascript `prompt` and enables styling on it. It also adds ability to change ok text, and allows to create custom return value other than true and false.

* notify - It is replacement of `alert` function in Javascript because when alert is active, everything else becomes inaccessible. With notify, everything is accessible even if notify is active. Furthermore with notify, we can modify the looks, we can specify icons for different kinds of notifications. By default every notification goes away in 5 seconds. But it can be made persistent.

* showPage - Upon a certain user action, any subpage can be displayed by providing the ID of the page. This function is used by our code.Suppose there is a hashchange, and we want to show another page upon that hashchange, the ssytem will use showPage

### Global variables

|   Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| appPages `array` | Add the IDs of pages that your app contains. This is used by `showPage()` to determine whether the hashchange was caused by a link that traverses pages or not |
| domRefs `object` | This global object is used by `getRef() ` to store repeatedly used DOM references. You don't have to change anything about it manually |

#### Functions 

### getRef()
Use this function instead of `document.getElementById()`. It provides reference memoization for repeatedly used DOM references. This negates the need to store DOM references at top of script or inside global variables.

### Event listeners
There are several event listeners added that listen for some basic changes in app life-cycle

### `online` and `offline`
These event listeners listen for changes in internet connectivity. Whenever app is disconnected from internet user will receive a notification displaying status of connection.

### `load`
This event is used to attack further event listeners when page resources are completely loaded. Also if app URL contains a page hash it'll also display that page.

### `hashchange`
This event notices the changes in hash in URL bar. If the changed hash is one of the appPages then that page will be displayed.

### `keyup`
Use this event listener if you want to add some keybinding at document level. By default it has keybinding to hide an open popup when `ESC` key is pressed.

### `pointerdown`
Mostly used to display ripple over the interactive elements. Any element containing `interact` class will receive ripple when clicked by user. You can customize the list of elements which receive ripple inside createRipple callback.

### `copy`
This is a purely UX feature, that shows a notification whenever user copies any content from the web app.
